- **Routes**: Define API and web endpoints.
- **Tests**: Ensure code quality and functionality.

### Frontend
- **Components**: Reusable UI elements.
- **Views**: Different pages of the application.
- **Router**: Manage navigation between views.
- **Store**: Handle application state.
- **Services**: Interact with backend APIs.

### Webapp Audit

# Iron Code Skins Architecture Documentation

## Project Overview
The "Iron Code Skins" platform is designed to provide a secure and efficient environment for trading digital assets, specifically skins for CS:GO. The platform aims to address the critical issues of trust and security in peer-to-peer transactions by implementing a legal-tech escrow service.

## Initial Project Structure
1. **Backend**
   - **Controllers**: Handle business logic and manage requests.
   - **Models**: Represent data structures and interactions.
   - **Services**: Facilitate interactions with external systems (e.g., payment gateways, Steam API, blockchain).
   - **Middleware**: Process requests and enforce security measures.
   - **Routes**: Define API and web endpoints for client interactions.
   - **Tests**: Ensure code quality through unit and feature testing.

2. **Frontend**
   - **Components**: Reusable UI elements for the application.
   - **Views**: Different pages of the application, providing user interfaces.
   - **Router**: Manages navigation between views.
   - **Store**: Manages application state using Vuex.
   - **Services**: Handles API requests and responses.

3. **Webapp Audit**
   - **Components**: UI elements specific to the audit functionalities.
   - **Crypto**: Logic for cryptographic verification of transactions.

4. **Infrastructure**
   - **Docker**: Containerization for backend and frontend services.
   - **Kubernetes**: Orchestration for managing containerized applications.
   - **Terraform**: Infrastructure as code for provisioning resources.

5. **Documentation**
   - **API**: Documentation for the backend API endpoints.
   - **Architecture**: Overview of the system architecture and design decisions.
   - **SOPs**: Standard Operating Procedures for operational consistency.

## Main Modules
- **User Management**: Handles user authentication and KYC processes.
- **Transaction Management**: Manages escrow services and payment processing.
- **Audit Logging**: Tracks user actions and transactions for compliance and security.
- **Blockchain Integration**: Implements a ledger of reputation for users.
- **Compliance**: Ensures adherence to legal standards such as LGPD and ISO certifications.

## Data Models
- **User**: 
  - `id`: Unique identifier for the user.
  - `name`: Full name of the user.
  - `email`: Email address for communication.
  - `password`: Hashed password for authentication.
  - `kyc_status`: Status of the KYC process (e.g., pending, approved).

- **Transaction**: 
  - `id`: Unique identifier for the transaction.
  - `user_id`: Identifier for the user involved in the transaction.
  - `amount`: Amount of the transaction.
  - `status`: Current status of the transaction (e.g., pending, completed).
  - `created_at`: Timestamp of when the transaction was created.

- **KYCDocument**: 
  - `id`: Unique identifier for the KYC document.
  - `user_id`: Identifier for the user associated with the document.
  - `document_type`: Type of document submitted (e.g., ID, proof of address).
  - `document_data`: Encrypted data of the document.

- **AuditLog**: 
  - `id`: Unique identifier for the audit log entry.
  - `action`: Description of the action taken (e.g., transaction created).
  - `user_id`: Identifier for the user who performed the action.
  - `timestamp`: Time when the action occurred.

## Roadmap for First Technical Deliveries

   - Create KYC processes and audit logging.

3. **Phase 2: Standard Automated (Months 5-10)**
   - Automate transaction processes and integrate payment gateways.
   - Launch the Standard version of the platform.

4. **Phase 3: Ecosystem & LRA (Months 11-14)**
   - Develop the Ledger of Reputation and integrate blockchain functionalities.
   - Enhance community features and support.

5. **Phase 4: Scale & Certifications (Months 15-18)**
   - Optimize infrastructure for scalability.
   - Obtain ISO 27001 and SOC 2 certifications.
